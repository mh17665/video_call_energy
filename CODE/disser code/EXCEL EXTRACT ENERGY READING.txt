With the energy readings from the py file in the spreadsheet, but surronded by words, use this to extract the numbers.
Put the energy reading sentences from 1-60 in cells A1-A60, copy and past the above into any cell that is in the 1 row.
Extend this equation downwards to 60 and you should have all 60 energy readings as numbers.
