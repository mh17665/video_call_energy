# SET UP
I set up a toxic client on the raspberry pi 4 with 4GB. Toxic is a client from the tox chat family, it has an ncurses interface written entirely of C so is reminiscent of a traditional CLI, this means the features it provides is minimal, but this leads to a great decrease in energy consumption. The other client in a video call with the pi client was an android phone running antox, another tox client available for android devices.
