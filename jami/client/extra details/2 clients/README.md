# SET UP
I set up a JAMI client on the raspberry pi 4 with 4GB of RAM. I used it to video call an android phone running the JAMI app, I left the resolution on the default.  
# EXTRA
## Bandwidth
Average transmit = 9.3mb    
Average recieve = 662kb    
## Main tasks
gnome-ring = 176.8% CPU, 4.3% MEM  
Dring = 92.4% CPU, 3.6% MEM  
Pulse audio = 18.9% CPU, 0.4% MEM    
Xorg = 13.5% CPU, 3.6% MEM  
## Storage  
dev/root = 1%     
tmpfs = 2%    
dev/sda1 = 19%    
## Quality
Generally okay but frame rate was low and pi slowed down. Took a while to find the other client, kept searching and connection, an issue with peer to peer systems.
