# SET UP
I set up a JAMI client on the raspberry pi 4 with 4GB of RAM. I used it to join a JAMI conference with an IPAD running the app, an android phone running the app and a windows laptop running the software, I left the resolution on the default.
# EXTRA
## Bandwidth
Average transmit = 33.2mb  
Average recieve = 525kb    
## Main tasks
gnome-ring = 163.7% CPU, 4.6% MEM  
Dring = 103.3% CPU, 4.1% MEM  
Pulse audio = 22.5% CPU, 0.4% MEM    
Xorg = 9.9% CPU, 4.3% MEM  
## Storage  
dev/root = 1%     
tmpfs = 2%    
dev/sda1 = 19%    
## Quality
A 4 client conference only worked by inviting the last participant in from one of the 2 working 3 client combinations explained earlier. The pi camera on all other devices is a screen that shows all 4 clients' cameras. Quality otherwise was generally okay. On the pi, the screen is all a buggy mess still.
